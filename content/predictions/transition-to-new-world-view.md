## Detailed Prediction
*The world is about to go through a rapid transition on the scale of the Enlightenment, calling this period the New Enlightenment or the Second Enlightenment Period.*

I am predicting that the world is about to go through a rapid transition on the scale of the Enlightenment, calling this period the New Enlightenment or the Second Enlightenment Period. 

We have entered the age of AI but clean energy technology like solar has become commoditized and gene-editing technology will make bioengineered humans a reality. By 2050 we will be living in a world that has a completely different set of rules.

**Success Criteria:** 

#### Technology Transformation Trends (by 2050)
- **AI Integration:** Significant increase in AI agent/copilot use across mainstream workforce and daily life
- **Energy Revolution:** Significant reduction in electricity costs making energy effectively abundant
- **Bioengineering Mainstream:** Widespread acceptance and adoption of bioengineering technologies in healthcare and human enhancement

#### Societal Structure Shifts (by 2050)
- **Decentralization Movement:** Measurable decrease in power/influence of large centralized companies
- **Governance Evolution:** Reduction in centralized government control with rise of distributed/local governance models
- **Economic Restructuring:** Shift away from traditional employment models toward new economic frameworks

#### Overall "New Enlightenment" Indicators
- **Accelerated Change:** Rate of technological and social change significantly faster than 2000-2025 period
- **Paradigm Shift:** Fundamental changes in how society organizes work, governance, and human enhancement
- **Rule Set Revolution:** Clear evidence that "the rules of the game" have fundamentally changed from today's norms

**Confidence Level:** ⬆️ Probable

**Target Resolution:** 2050-01-01
