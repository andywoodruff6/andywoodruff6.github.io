I'm a builder. Businesses and ecosystems, Software and hardware. Currently, I serve as Executive Director of the [Open Commercial Media Ecosystem](https://ocmeco.org). With a degree in mechanical engineering and roles ranging from test engineer to application engineer, smart contract developer, product owner, and project manager, I've evolved beyond traditional engineering definitions. Today, I focus on building systems and solutions that address fundamental challenges in digital trust and economic transformation.

## Global Problems
- GP1: The lack of cryptographically secure / tamper-evident identity in digital technology has eroded trust.
- GP2: The death of the old world creates unprecedented opportunity, but most people lack the tools and mindset to capitalize on the transformation rather than just survive it.
- GP3: Upskilling is easier than ever, and more important than ever, yet wildly under appreciated.

## Personal Mission
- M1: I'm developing decentralized systems that restore economic agency to creators and professionals by providing cryptographically secure alternatives to gatekeeper-controlled industries.
- M2: I'm building awareness of the transition to a new world view by creating accessible tools that help people thrive rather than just survive this transformation.
