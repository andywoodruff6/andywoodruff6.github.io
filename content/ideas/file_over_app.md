## What is File Over App?

File over app is a philosophy: if you want to create digital artifacts that last, they must be files you can control, in formats that are easy to retrieve and read. Use tools that give you this freedom.

## Why is it important?

Applications come and go. Formats change. The bulk of our digital lives has only existed for a few decades and in that short time hundereds of companies have come and gone. 

We all want our files, and data to exist for a life time. In order to do that you must use formats that are open standards and tools that allow you to control your data. Formats like this would include `.txt`, `.csv`, `.md`.

## Tools

It is this reason that I use Obsidian as my main source of digital notes.
