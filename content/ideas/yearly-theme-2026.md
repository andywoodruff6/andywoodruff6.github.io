## The Theme

**Scale Your Compute** — The continuation of high-agency intensity, channeled through systems that multiply output.

### Theme Progression
- **2024: Manufacture Opportunities** — Position yourself for good things to happen
- **2025: High Agency** — Less planning, more doing
- **2026: Scale Your Compute** — Multiply the results of each action through AI, automation, and software systems

### Why This Theme
The gnawing drive to get things done stays. The 60-hour weeks of direct labor don't.

2025 proved that intensity works (OCME milestones, 501(c)(6), 5.1M views). But Q4 also proved that raw hours don't scale and come at a health cost. The AI daemon goal succeeded because I built something that runs. The 2026 question: **what else can you build that runs without you?**

"Compute" is literal: AI systems, software tools, automation that execute work. Whether prompting AI tools or writing code, the mechanism is computational leverage. Each unit of effort should yield more than one unit of result.

This theme gives permission to spend time building infrastructure rather than doing direct work; which can feel unproductive in the moment but compounds toward 2034.
