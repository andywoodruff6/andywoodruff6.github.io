## Overview


## World View Adjustment

**Old Mental Model**: What is the current default view?  
**New Mental Model**: What is the new proposal?  
**Transition Strategy**: What are practical ways to make the shift?  
**Real World Example**: How can this be put into practice today?


## Book Notes

### Chapter 1

- One of Peter's favorite questions to ask someone when interviewing for a job is:
	- "What important truth do very few people agree with you on?"
### Chapter 2

- There was a lot of hysteria in the dot com bubble that has sense pushed people from technology to globalization. 

My Thoughts: [[2025-03-31]]
- It feels like this has swung back the other way a bit with AI. We have had several new technology innovations 

### Chapter 3

- Every business is successful to the extent that it does something that others cannot
- either fight and win quickly or don't fight at all

### Chapter 4

- 
### Chapter 5

The goal is to be the last mover in a industry so that you can earn decades of monopolistic profits

### Chapter 6

- We encourage students/intellectual to diversify through middle and high school and even college. Wow we do the exact opposite with sports. You never see anyone promoting a D1 college football player to go try out swimming so that way he's a more well-rounded athlete.
[[Peter Thiel|Thiel]] sees four personality categories:
- **Indefinite Pessimism**: Most people in the world today are pessimistic. Indefinite people believe that the world is luck based and that they have no control so they just react to what ever happened yesterday. 
	- Since the bleak future cannot be known they prefer to eat, drink and be merry
- **Definite Pessimism**: The future can be know but it is bleak and should prepare for it by building only what has been done before. Copy with minor refinement.
- **Definite Optimism**: The future will be better if they plan for it and work to make it better. These are people who are creating value to share to the world.
	- Probably now under the name of e/acc.
- **Indefinite Optimism**: They future will be better because it just gets better. There is no way to know exactly how so there is no need to make specific plans.
	- The baby boom created a generation of people who feel that they are entitled to prosper because that is the only thing they have ever known.
	- Since tracked careers worked for them they cannot see how they would not work for their kids.
	- The government is peak indefinite optimism. We just send out money hoping things get better.
	- We no longer are trying to extend life and health span.

- The Indefinite Optimism future is unlikely to occur given that households are not saving for the future and businesses are not reinvesting cashflows into progress.
	- This kind of thinking leads to the belief that other people will create a better life for you so you can rest and not take the risk required to build the better future.
	- We bring Darwinism thinking into the corporate world, yet there is no proof of a link. Just like Newtonian physics explains the natural world yet breaks down at the quantum or black hold scales. Why should animal evolution over hundreds or thousands of years represent corporate America over the next ten.

We need a cultural revolution to shift from indefinite to definite. 
### Chapter 7
- Venture Capital rule number 1: only invest in companies who can pay for the whole fund.
- Rule number two: DO NOT BREAK RULE NUMBER 1.
- If you understand the power law you put your eggs in as few baskets as possible.
	- It does matter what you do, but before you pick something you should consider whether it will be valuable in the future.
	- Being in the right company will dwarf being in the right role.

### Chapter 8 Secrets

- Is it difficult or impossible?
- If there are many secrets left in the world, then there are many world changing companies ready to be built
- Ted Kaczynski believed that all hard problems had already been solved. There were only easy and impossible tasks left.

My note [[2025-04-02]]: This is is representative of [THIS](https://x.com/MKBHD/status/1002391544866000897) tweet from MKBHD.

- Incrementalism - only do whats asked of you and do not over achieve.
- Risk aversion: 
- Complacency: why seek new when you can charge for what already exists
- Globalization has made the world feel flat. If something was out there to discover, wouldn't someone have already done it.

- You cannot find secrets without looking for them.
- There are two kinds of secrets:
	- Those of **nature**
	- Those of **people**
- The best place to look for secrets, is where no one is looking.
### Chapter 9

Discussed the core tenants that start ups should have.

### Chapter 10

-  driving extreme company culture ( cult / mafia like ) is the only way your company will grow and succeed. 
- Employing consultants makes no sense as they have no real vested interest in the company
