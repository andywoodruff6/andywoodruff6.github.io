The Shifting Current is a Substack blog that serves as the primary output of my second mission (M2): building awareness of the transition to a new world view by creating accessible tools that help people thrive rather than just survive this transformation.

Through this blog, I explore the fundamental shifts happening in our economic, technological, and social systems. The content focuses on making complex transformational concepts accessible to a broader audience, helping readers understand and prepare for the changing landscape ahead.

The blog serves as a bridge between the technical work of decentralized systems development and the practical need for widespread understanding of these emerging paradigms.
