The OCME enables creators, curators and industry members to maximize reach, unlock new revenue opportunities, and drive innovation in content commercialization.

As the Chair of the Industry Advisory Council, I lead a diverse group of industry experts, advising and guiding the development of our Ecosystem. My primary responsibility is to drive our Governance Framework to ensure the OCME can best support creators, curators, and industry members in maximizing reach, unlocking new revenue opportunities, and driving innovation. I work closely with stakeholders to leverage cutting-edge technologies like AI, decentralized identity and blockchain, ensuring the OCME remains transparent and open-by-default. In this role, I also facilitate collaboration and knowledge-sharing among council members, helping to drive adoption and growth of the OCME across the industry.
