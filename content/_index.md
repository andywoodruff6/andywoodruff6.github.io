# Driven towards the bleeding edge by an obsession for efficiency and innovation.

I am an experienced Product Owner and Project Manager who has delivered 6 products to market and managed several multi million dollar projects. I am PMP Certified and have a Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering.

## Mission

- M1: I'm developing decentralized systems that restore economic agency to creators and professionals by providing cryptographically secure alternatives to traditional gatekeeper-controlled industries.
- M2: I'm building awareness of the transition to a new world view by creating accessible tools that help people thrive rather than just survive this transformation.

## Projects
Projects outside of the 9 to 5 is one of the best ways to grow. Currently I have several leadership positions, including roles at The [Open Commercial Media Ecosystem](https://ocmeco.org) and The [Trust over IP Foundation](https://trustoverip.org/). Go to the Projects page for more details.

## Predictions
Making predictions is super important in order to be proactive instead of reactive. You can get a retroactive return on your investment by making the correct predictions of the future and I'm not talking about the stock market gains. This is how you put yourself in a position to get lucky. Hint it's not luck, it's hard work. 

## Ideas
Ideas shape who we are, and not enough of us are in touch with our true thoughts. I started journaling in 2022 around the same time I started keeping a digital "notebook" (obsidian). Freedom of thought is only possible when you can actually express your thoughts and stand behind them.

## Curation
In the age of generative AI **slop**, curation will be hands down the most important skill for understanding what is going on in the world around you. In seconds anyone will be able to generate a fake news article, a fake image, or even a fake video. Finding real people with real values sharing real information will be key to navigating this new world.
